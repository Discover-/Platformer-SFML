* Order repository files
* Implement cannon like in Mario
* Finish implementatation of the crate object which you can push away so it can help you
* Update Bonus Tile:
  - Add more 'surprises' to the bonus block: plant growing out, star jumping out, mushroom ontop moves out, etc.
  - Only make the bonus block trigger when hit from the bottom
  - Store all 'surprises' in the class in a vector with pair id and texture and load these from Level class (Textures) (can only do this when we get more than one type of surprise)
* Add mini menu in-game rather than just 'PAUSED'
* Move all positions to Position struct or sf::Vector2f
* When hitting an enemy, bounce away based on which side you hit it not on enemy's current direction
* Implement proper falling logic (currently you fall straight down after letting go move button in air)
* Proper collision detection on movingtile
* Get rid of the small 'bounce' when you hit the ground after jumping
* Implement keys and locks to access new level
* Check 'timestep' rather than FPS limit (http://www.cppforum.nl/index.php/topic,2531.msg16014.html#msg16014)
* Implement zooming out (MouseWheelMoved)
* Add more IsInRange calls
* Implement climbing to clouds like mario
* Implement turtle enemy and when killing it, pushing it kills all enemies on its path
* Re-write bullets
  - Make them go faster
  - New graphics for them
  - Add several types of bullets or upgrades
* Improve animations
* Loading screen (seperate thread?)
* Make Game class singleton/static
* Make possible for player to fall inbetween two tiles (if one is missing, like a gap) for proper collision for special tiles like Spikes, Lava, Water and Quicksand
* Add mouse-over collision detection for menu's
* Increase width (perhaps in the code itself) of some of the decoration objects (rocks, fences, grass, bushes, etc.) to make it less of a level-editor feel (having them placed inbetween two tiles, rather than always ON a tile)
* Sound management (volume, etc.)
* Figure out why loading takes really long
* Make small coins in upper left corner appear on now rows every 5th coin
* Fix quicksand collision
* Add logo (icon) to the game, a name, etc.
